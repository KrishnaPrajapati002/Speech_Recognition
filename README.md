# Speech_Recognition
The Multilingual Speech Recognition project is a Flask-based web application designed to transcribe audio into text. It supports both live audio recording and file uploads and offers automatic or manual language selection. The core purpose of this system is to facilitate the transcription of spoken content from different languages using a simple web interface, making it suitable for users in multilingual environments or educational tools requiring diverse language support. The app leverages several important Python libraries. Flask is the primary web framework, responsible for managing HTTP requests, handling routing, and rendering templates. For handling audio input on the client side, HTML and JavaScript are used to create a user-friendly interface. On the backend, the ‘speech_recognition’ library provides tools for capturing and processing audio data. It supports multiple recognizer engines, including Google Web Speech API, which can recognize speech in various languages. This functionality is crucial to ensuring multilingual support. The core functionality involves uploading an audio file or recording speech through the browser. Users can either rely on automatic language detection or manually select a language. Once the audio is submitted, it is processed on the backend, where the appropriate language recognizer is initialized. The transcribed text is then returned and displayed in the user interface. This system is designed with flexibility in mind, allowing users to handle audio in many common formats and switch languages as needed. The application stands out due to its support for multiple languages and its ease of use. Users without technical expertise can simply select a language, upload or record audio, and receive text output. This makes it particularly useful for educators, journalists, or content creators who work with diverse language inputs. The real-time capabilities also enhance its appeal in situations where immediate transcription is required, such as interviews, lectures, or live events. Future enhancements could include integration with translation APIs to convert recognized speech into another language, improving accessibility for global users. Additionally, expanding the speech recognition engine options or incorporating noise reduction tools could further enhance accuracy and user experience. Overall, this application provides a robust starting point for multilingual speech recognition in a web environment.
